#+TITLE: README

A simple celebration of Pi Day 2022 that utilises some things I find interesting about Lisp like HOFs and its ability to generate symbolic expressions (valid Lisp code) rather than just values.

The code generates symbolic (Lisp) expressions which represent particular infinite expressions for the value of $\pi$, computed to an arbitrary depth. It then uses a library to convert that to a valid LaTeX form, as well as evaluating the expression to get a numeric approximation for $\pi$. It works best when viewed as LaTeX or a PDF, since the symbols and expressions are rendered properly.

Since the project is written as a literate document, it's interspersed with some light rambling about the mathematics behind these approximations, which somebody hopefully finds interesting.
